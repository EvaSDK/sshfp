KNOWN BUGS:

20060927
- sshfp -a xelerance.com -o 1 @ns1.xelerance.com gives:
  AXFR error: ns1.xelerance.com No permission or not authorative for  xelerance.com -o 1 ; aborting
- Running sshfp against the same nameserver twice using -a @ns0 gives different output all the
  time. Looks like ssh-keyscan is sensitive to failures.

20060921:
- if a zone contains non-working glue A records, then ssh-keyscan aborts. Bug reported upstream
