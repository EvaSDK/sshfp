.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates RFC4255 SSHFP DNS records based on the public keys stored in a
known_hosts file, which implies the user has previously trusted this key,
or can be obtained by using 
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
. Using 
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
implies a secure path to connect to the hosts being scanned. It also implies
a trust in the DNS to obtain the IP address of the hostname to be scanned.
.Pp
If the domain allows for
.Ar AXFR
transfers, an entire domain can be processed for 
.Ar A
records to convert.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k
.Oo Ar knownhosts_file
.It Fl knownhosts
.Oo Ar knownhosts_file
Obtain the host public
.Cm SSH
keys from a 
.Pa known_hosts. If no argument is given, it defaults to
.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
.It Fl s, scan Ar hostname | domainname
Obtain the host public
.Cm SSH
keys via
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1
If
.Fl a
is used, the argument implies a domain name for use of
.Cm AXFR
The hostnames or domain records are found using normal DNS procedures, which
is vulnerable to
.Cm Man in the middle
attacks. Theoretically, the
.Xr ssh-keyscan 1.
connection can also be
.Cmhijacked
.It Fl a
.Oo Ar @ns
.It Fl all
.Oo Ar @ns
When used with
.Fl k .
.Oo Ar knownhosts_file
generate SSHFP records for all entries in the known_hosts file. If no argument is given, it defaults to
.Pa ~/.ssh/known_hosts
If used in combination with
.Fl s .
perform an
.Cm AXFR
transfer to obtain the entire zone file, and generate SSHFP records for all
the
.Cm A
records found in the zone. The client needs to be authorized to do an
.Cm AXFR
transfer.
.It Fl t
.It Fl trailing-dot
Add a trailing dot to the hostname in the SSHFP records.  It is not possible
to determine whether a known_hosts or dns query is for a FQDN (eg www.xelerance.com)
or not (eg www) or not (unless 
.Fl -d domainname -a
 is used, in which case a trailing dot is always appended). Non-FQDN get their
domainname appended through
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
These non-FQDN will happen when using a non-FQDN, eg
.Ic sshfp -k www
or known_hosts entries obtained by running
.Ic ssh www.sub
where 
.Ic .domain.com
is implied. When
.Fl t .
is used, all hostnames not ending with a dot, that at least contain two parts in their
hostname (eg
.Ic www.sub
but not
.Ic www
) get a trailing dot. Note that the output of
.Nm
can also just be manually editted for trailing dots.

.nNm

		sshfp -f /tmp/known_hosts bofh.xelerance.com www.openswan.org
		sshfp -a -t -d xelerance.com @ns0.xelerance.net

ISSUES

  Using non-FQDN names (eg 'www' instead of 'www.xelerance.com'), either
  with ssh or sshfp can result in confusion or inconsistent records if the
  resolving behaviour changes, such as by modifying /etc/resolv.conf. 


  Trailing dot

  Obtained SSHFP records can be hand-edited to append the domain suffix if necessary.

.Sh TODO
Write a verify mode where we check:
.Pp
If the SSHFP record matches the actual host key
.Pp
If the SSHFP record matches the known_hosts entry
.Pp
If the known_hosts entry matches the actual host key
.Sh HISTORY
sshfp was originally written by Xelerance to harvest, generate and populate
.CmSSHFP
records in their DNSSEC secured zonefiles.
