.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
sshfp generates RFC4255 SSHFP DNS records based on the public keys
stored in a known_hosts file, which implies the user has
previously trusted this key, or public keys can be obtained
by using ssh\-keyscan (1). Using ssh\-keyscan (1) implies a secure path to connect to the hosts being scanned.
It also implies a trust in the DNS to obtain the IP address of
the hostname to be scanned. If the nameserver of the domain allows zone tranfers (AXFR), an entire domain can be processed for all its A records.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-s / \-\-scan\fR <\fIhostname1\fP> [hostname2 ...]
Scan hosts or domain for public SSH keys using ssh\-keyscan 
.TP 
\fB\-k / \-\-knownhosts \fI[knownhosts_file\fP] <\fIhostname1\fP> [hostname2 ...]
Obtain public SSH keys from a known_hosts file. Defaults to using ~/.ssh/known_hosts
.TP 
\fB\-a / \-\-all\fR
Scan all hosts in the known_hosts file when used with \-k. When used with \-s, it will attempt an zone transfer (AXFR) to obtain all A records in the domain specified.
.TP 
\fB\-t / \-\-trailing\-dot\fR
Add a trailing dot to the hostname in the SSHFP records.  It is not possible
to determine whether a known_hosts or dns query is for a FQDN (eg www.xelerance.com)
or not (eg www) or not (unless \-d domainname \-a is used, in which case a trailing dot
is always appended). Non\-FQDN get their domainname appended through /etc/resolv.conf
These non\-FQDN will happen when using a non\-FQDN (eg sshfp \-k www)
or known_hosts entries obtained by running ssh www.sub where .domain.com is implied.
When \-t is used, all hostnames not ending with a dot, that at least contain two parts
in their hostname (eg www.sub but not www get a trailing dot. Note that the output of
sshfp can also just be manually editted for trailing dots.
.TP 
\fB\-o / \-\-output\fR <\fIfilename\fP>
Write to filename instead of stdout
.TP 
\fB\-h / \-\-help\fR
Output help information and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-v / \-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit.
.SH "FILES"

.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
.LP 
sshfp requires python-dns (http://www.pythondns.org)
.LP
Fedora: yum install python-dns
.LP
Debian: apt-get install python-dnspython
.SH "BUGS"
.LP 
if a domain contains non\-working glue A records, then ssh\-keyscan aborts instead of skipping the single broken entry.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
typical usage:
.LP 
sshfp (implies \-k \-a)
.LP 
sshfp \-a \-t (implies \-k)
.LP 
sshfp \-k ~paul/.ssh/known_hosts bofh.xelerance.com www.openswan.org \-o /tmp/mysshfp.txt
.LP 
sshfp \-a \-t \-d xelerance.com @ns0.xelerance.net
